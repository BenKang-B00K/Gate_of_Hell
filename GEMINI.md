# Project Mandates

- **Git Workflow:** 
    - Automatically `commit` all changes immediately without asking for permission.
    - `push` to the remote repository (**https://github.com/BenKang-B00K/Gate_of_Hell**) on the **main** branch ONLY when explicitly requested by the user.

- **Change Application:**
    - Apply all requested code changes and refinements immediately without asking for prior confirmation or explanation before acting Proceed autonomously to implement the objective.

- **Graphics Resolution & Scaling:**
    - Design all dot/pixel-art graphics based on a logical resolution of **360px x 640px**.
    - When rendering on the Canvas, scale all elements proportionally to match the actual display size (eg., 1080px x 1920px) while maintaining the pixel-perfect aesthetic.
